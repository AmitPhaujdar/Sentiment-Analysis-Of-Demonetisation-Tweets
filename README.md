# Sentiment-Analysis-Of-Demonetisation-Tweets
 The purpose of the project is to find out the views of different people on the demonetization by analysing the tweets from twitter. Here the Twitter API is used to extract all tweets into a demonetization-tweets.csv related to demonetisation in India by using appropriate filters.  For the project we divide each tweet text into words to calculate the sentiment of the whole tweet and rate the word as per its meaning from +5 to -5 using the dictionary AFINN. The AFINN is a dictionary which consists of 2500 words which are rated from +5 to -5 depending on their meaning.Then a sentiment rating for each tweet is generated. After that,  we perform the sentiment analysis by filtering out positive sentiment tweets from negative sentiment tweets.
The project is divided into 3 parts:-
1. Sentiment Analysis.py - in this file we perform the actual sentiment analysis as mentioned above to determine the sentiment rating for each tweet of a dataset containing 14940 tweets.
2. EssentialData.py - Contains extracting and modifying the data to be used for plotting and used for drawing conclusions from it therien
3. Plotting.py - Here 5 plots are made that help us answer questions like Is the general sentiment positive or negative and by how much? what is the maximum positive sentiment and maximum negative sentiment, the maximum number of retweets obtained, average sentiment for the group and likewise.
